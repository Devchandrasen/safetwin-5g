# SafeTwin-5G

SafeTwin-5G is a research and product project for **causal, uncertainty-aware
network digital twins that support safe closed-loop operations in private 5G
and future 6G networks**.

The project was locked on **2026-08-24**. Its research identity is
**Trustworthy Autonomous Networks**. The scope and claim boundaries are defined
in [PROJECT_LOCK.md](PROJECT_LOCK.md).

## Current status

**Phase 0: intervention and safety foundation**

Implemented on day one:

- a strict schema for telemetry-backed intervention records;
- a selective safety gate that rejects unsupported or irreversible actions;
- mandatory abstention when confidence or distribution-shift checks fail;
- mandatory human approval for every otherwise-eligible sandbox action;
- an append-only JSONL intervention store;
- a CLI for environment checks, a safe-decision demo, and log validation;
- unit tests for contracts, safety decisions, and dataset integrity.

This repository does **not** yet contain evidence from a running Open5GS
network. Docker was installed but stopped at project creation; it has now been
started and verified. Fixture, simulation, sandbox, and live results must always
be labelled separately.

## Setup

From this directory in PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv --system-site-packages
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e .
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Inspect the local environment:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 doctor
```

Run the day-one safety demo:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 demo
```

Validate an intervention log:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 validate-log .\examples\interventions.example.jsonl
```

## Research question

> Can an intervention-trained network digital twin estimate the effects of
> candidate remediation actions and safely abstain or escalate under
> uncertainty, reducing SLA violations without increasing harmful actions?

## Immediate next gate

Bring up an isolated, version-pinned Open5GS + UERANSIM + Prometheus sandbox.
No algorithmic result will be called a live-network result until controlled
faults, actions, timestamps, and outcomes are captured from that sandbox.
